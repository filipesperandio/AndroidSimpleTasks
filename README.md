# SimpleTasks


This repo is intended to experiment with different technologies for building apps.
Each directory should be an app by itself using a specific sets of frameworks.

The idea is that they build the same (or similar) app which could have the following features:

- Tasks - a basic TO DO list kind of app
  - Multiple task lists
  - Shared lists
- Notifications for task alarms
- Data backed in the cloud
- User privacy
- Auto sync

The first version of the app using Ionic/Cordova/Angular can be found on Play Store,
